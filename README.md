# PtgWarscrollGeneratorDownload

This app aims to merge the standard unit warscrolls from NewRecruit with 4th ed Path to Glory rules, maintaining the NewRecruit format.


## What it does
- Adds Path to Glory-specific fields Path and Glory.
- Clears out numeric values like Hit that could change when earning Path ranks
- Adds blank rows to both Abilities sections to accomodate additional abilities gained from Path ranks


## Installation
1. Click the 'PtG Warscroll Generator.zip' file in the top section of this page
2. Click the ellipsis (3 dot icon) button in the top-right and select 'Download'. Save the file anywhere on your PC
3. Unzip the file anywhere on your PC. No other installation is needed


## How to use
1. Create a new list or go to an existing list in NewRecruit, selecting all options you want on each unit
2. Click 'Export' in the top-right of NewRecruit and select the 'Pretty' option
3. Click the gear icon in the top-right to display export options
4. In the top-level options, make sure only 'Cards' is selected. Under 'Cards' select 'One per page' ('Sort by name' is fine as well). Other export options have not been tested with the app yet
5. Click 'Save as HTML' to save the export to your PC
6. Go into the PtG Warscroll Generator folder and open the application file (it's the one without an extension on the filename)
7. Click 'Select File' and find your NewRecruit export file
8. Click 'Create Datasheets' and save the file anywhere on your PC. The default name is the original export's name plus 'PtG', but feel free to name it whatever your want
9. Open the new file using your internet browser and print it
10. Administer self-congratulatory pat on the back for dealing with my janky process


## Additional notes
- Most sheets will fit a single 8.5x11 printer page, but larger ones can grow to two pages. If this happens you can print that page separately and scale the contents down in the print menu in order to force the sheet to fit on one page
- For your Anvil hero, I recommend using NewRecruit's PtG functionality to build the unit. This will help get more of the extra abilities on the warscroll before running it through this app
- Testing on this has been fairly limited, so let me know if you run into any issues
